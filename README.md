Explanation of mcts_modified.py:

Since experience with traditional tic-tac-toe suggests that choosing to play in the corners is a more winnable option than playing in the five squares of the center cross, my heuristic for improvement is to prioritize playing in the corners if the robot can. The implementation of this code is located in the rollout function.
